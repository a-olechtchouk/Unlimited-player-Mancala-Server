# Unlimited-player-Mancala-Server
A game server written in C based on the board game Mancala, where any amount of users can join. Utilizes sockets to establish connections between the game server and each client/player, where players are stored in or removed from a dynamically allocated linked-list by calling malloc() or free(). Additionally, features a concurrent design that uses select() to check file descriptors, allowing any action from all players without halting the game. I.e, the game continues normally if users join or leave at any point during the game (including during some playerâ€™s turn).
